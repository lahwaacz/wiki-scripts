Feature: Syncing the page tables

    Background:
        Given an api to an empty MediaWiki
        And an empty wiki-scripts database

    Scenario: Syncing empty wiki
        When I synchronize the wiki-scripts database
        Then the recent changes should match
        And the logevents should match
        And the allpages lists should match
        And the revisions should match

    Scenario: Syncing empty page
        When I create page "Test"
        And I synchronize the wiki-scripts database
        Then the recent changes should match
        And the allpages lists should match
        And the revisions should match

    Scenario: Syncing empty page after empty sync
        When I synchronize the wiki-scripts database

        And I synchronize the wiki-scripts database
        Then the recent changes should match
        And the allpages lists should match
        And the revisions should match

    Scenario: Syncing edited page

        And I synchronize the wiki-scripts database
        And I edit page "Test" to contain "bbb"
        And I synchronize the wiki-scripts database
        Then the recent changes should match
        And the allpages lists should match
